# Guide to Import Data into Sanity

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up a project and import data into Sanity for the Products models.

---

## **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

Start by cloning the repository containing the Sanity project and import scripts:

Use Github Desktop to clone the repo `( Recommended )`

or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anasseth/next-ecommerce-template-4.git
cd next-ecommerce-template-4
```

---

## **Step 2: Install Dependencies**

Run the following command to install all required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## **Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory:

2. Open `.env` and add the following environment variables:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION="2025-01-15"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID="{your-sanity-project-id}"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="production"
   SANITY_API_TOKEN="{your-sanity-api-token}"
   ```

   - **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`**: Found in your Sanity project.
   - **`SANITY_API_TOKEN`**: Generate a token by navigating to **Settings > API > Add API Token** in your Sanity dashboard. Give the token appropriate read/write permissions - Select `Developer`.
   - **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`**: Set this to `production`.

## **Step 4: Import Data**

Run the following command to import sample data for `Product` models:

```bash
npm run import-data
```

---

## **Step 5: Verify the Data in Sanity Studio**

1. Go to your Sanity Studio project.
2. You should see `Product` models
3. Model will have some sample documents automatically populated after the import.

## **Troubleshooting Tips**

- Ensure that your API token has proper permissions to write data to your dataset.
- Double-check that your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `SANITY_API_TOKEN` values are correct.
- If errors occur during data import, review the terminal logs for detailed messages.

By following these steps, you will successfully import sample data into your Sanity project and have functional models ready for use.
